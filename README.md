# Behaviour

Behaviour is a library that integrate some stupid but useful functionalities.

It has some polyfills such as:

	- startsWith and endsWith: declared into String.prototype, they are such clever methods and
								now those coulbe be used in any browser you want (IE 9+ included);
								
	- newEl(  ): that is a function that allows to create HTMLElements and initialize them with: the id, the CSS classes
				and the HTML attributes  ( e.g "data-role" or "title" )
